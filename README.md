# HydroPy DEM: Automating hydrological correction of Digital Elevation Models for enhanced urban flood modeling

## Introduction

Flooding poses significant threats to communities and ecosystems, making accurate flood modeling a crucial aspect of disaster preparedness and environmental management. High-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) serve as the foundation for these models, providing detailed topographic information essential for simulating flood scenarios. However, the challenge arises when raw Lidar data results in hydrologically disconnected DEMs, impacting the accuracy of flood model simulations.


The hydrological disconnection in Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) occurs as a consequence of Lidar scanning, which captures intricate details, including bridges and culverts, from an aerial perspective. When viewed from above, these structures might appear as disruptions in the stream network, leading Lidar to interpret them as barriers, akin to dams, and causing the DEM to represent disconnected waterways. In reality, water flows beneath bridges and within culverts, but Lidar's top-down interpretation introduces a spatial misrepresentation. Correcting this issue demands meticulous manual efforts by modelers to differentiate between genuine topographic features and artificial disruptions. The process involves recognizing and adjusting Lidar-induced misinterpretations, making the hydrological correction of DEMs a time-consuming and labor-intensive task.

Hydrologically disconnected DEMs can lead to inaccuracies in predicting flood patterns and waterway behaviors. When modelling structures like bridges, culverts, and man-made structures can disrupt the natural flow of water, creating artificial stream flows or, in severe cases, causing water pooling. Addressing this issue requires extensive time and effort from modelers, who must manually correct DEMs to ensure hydrological connectivity and remove obstructions.

In response to these challenges, the DEM Waterway Refinement GIS Tool emerges as a groundbreaking solution. This tool focuses on automating the preprocessing of DEMs, particularly in the identification and removal of artificial obstructions within waterways. By doing so, it aims to streamline the time-consuming and labor-intensive processes associated with flood modeling, ultimately improving the accuracy of simulations.
